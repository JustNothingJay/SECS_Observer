    <h2>The 24-Hour Governed Burn</h2>
    <p>
        A continuous 24-hour execution burn validated the substrate's core guarantees: 
        determinism, collapse correctness, timing-envelope stability, and purity under 
        uninterrupted load. Governed mode held <strong>4.0 RPS exactly</strong> with 
        <strong>0.00 stdev</strong>, demonstrating that drift is not merely controlled — 
        it is structurally impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
        No burst leakage, jitter accumulation, or envelope violations occurred across the 
        entire burn. The substrate maintained perfect temporal discipline, proving that 
        governed execution is not probabilistic or best-effort, but a deterministic 
        physics with measurable invariants.
    </p>
    <p>
        This burn serves as a reference behaviour: a canonical fingerprint of how the 
        substrate behaves when fully aligned. Any deviation from this pattern is treated 
        as evidence of impurity, misalignment, or external interference.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Mode Separation in Practice</h2>
    <p>
        Governed and ungoverned workloads coexisted without contamination. During the burn, 
        <strong>10 governed workers</strong> and <strong>724,582 ungoverned workers</strong> 
        shared the substrate with zero fairness bleed, zero collapse events, and zero 
        behavioural leakage.
    </p>
    <p>
        This separation is not enforced through heuristics or scheduling tricks. It is a 
        doctrinal boundary: governed mode inherits invariants, while ungoverned mode 
        inherits freedom. Neither can influence the other's behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result is a substrate where purity is preserved even in mixed-mode environments. 
        Mode separation is therefore not a feature — it is a structural truth.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Purity Under Load</h2>
    <p>
        Across the entire burn, impurity did not survive execution. No nondeterminism 
        entered governed mode. No drift accumulated. No collapse boundaries were breached. 
        Purity held as a structural invariant.
    </p>
    <p>
        The substrate actively rejects behaviours that violate determinism or continuity. 
        Impurity is not tolerated, mitigated, or compensated for — it is eliminated through 
        collapse or non-admission.
    </p>
    <p>
        This demonstrates that purity is not a target state but a maintained condition. 
        The substrate enforces it continuously, ensuring that governed execution remains 
        mathematically stable.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>The Permatest Beacon</h2>
    <p>
        The Permatest Beacon is the substrate's continuous integrity test — a live probe 
        that validates deterministic timing envelopes, state transitions, and stability 
        fingerprints. During the burn, it recorded ~33.6 µs average latency with zero 
        envelope violations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The beacon does not measure performance; it measures truth. It confirms that the 
        substrate's behaviour remains invariant across time, load, and topology.
    </p>
    <p>
        As long as the beacon holds, the substrate is considered stable. Any deviation 
        triggers investigation, collapse, or isolation to preserve the truth-state.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Deterministic Dispatch</h2>
    <p>
        Dispatch remained invariant under load, topology, and time. Workers executed 
        without drift, jitter, or topology-dependent behaviour. Determinism held across 
        all execution windows.
    </p>
    <p>
        This behaviour proves that dispatch is not influenced by identity, locality, or 
        probabilistic fairness. It is governed by invariant-safe rules that produce the 
        same outcome regardless of external conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deterministic dispatch is therefore a cornerstone of the substrate's physics — 
        a guarantee that execution paths remain stable and predictable.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Collapse Boundaries</h2>
    <p>
        Divergence was detected, isolated, and collapsed before it could propagate. 
        Collapse is not an error — it is a governance instrument that restores invariants 
        and preserves the substrate's truth-state.
    </p>
    <p>
        Collapse boundaries define the limits of acceptable behaviour. When a workload 
        crosses these boundaries, the substrate intervenes immediately and deterministically.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ensures that impurity cannot accumulate, drift cannot spread, and the 
        substrate's lived history remains coherent.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Continuity Markers</h2>
    <p>
        Continuity markers are deterministic checkpoints that anchor narrative closure, 
        replay points, and reconciliation boundaries. They ensure that the substrate's 
        lived history remains coherent and auditable.
    </p>
    <p>
        These markers allow the substrate to reconstruct truth even after collapse, 
        topology changes, or external disturbances. They are the backbone of continuity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without continuity markers, the substrate would lose its ability to maintain 
        a stable narrative. With them, history becomes a governed asset.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Topology-Free Behaviour</h2>
    <p>
        The substrate executed identically across all worker topologies. No noisy 
        neighbours, no scheduling heuristics, no probabilistic fairness. Behaviour 
        remained invariant regardless of physical layout.
    </p>
    <p>
        This proves that the substrate does not rely on locality or topology to maintain 
        determinism. Execution is governed by invariants, not by infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Topology-free behaviour is therefore a signature of the substrate's physics — 
        a guarantee that execution remains stable even as the environment changes.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Identity-Free Execution</h2>
    <p>
        The substrate does not know identity, tenancy, or routing. It knows only 
        behaviour, mode, and invariants. This enables deterministic fairness and 
        eliminates identity-dependent drift.
    </p>
    <p>
        By removing identity from execution, the substrate prevents bias, leakage, and 
        behavioural contamination. All workloads are evaluated solely on their 
        alignment with truth-conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Identity-free execution is therefore a doctrinal requirement: fairness emerges 
        from ignorance, and determinism emerges from constraint.
