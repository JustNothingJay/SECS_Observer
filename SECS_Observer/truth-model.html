            The formal definition of truth inside SECS Sovereign — the conditions under which

    <h2>Truth as a Structural Property</h2>
    <p>
        In SECS Sovereign, truth is not an opinion or an interpretation. It is a structural
        property engineered into the substrate. A behaviour is true only when it satisfies
        every declared invariant and extends continuity without distortion.
    </p>
    <p>
        This definition wasn’t borrowed from philosophy — it emerged from the practical
        need to build a system that cannot drift, lie, or contradict itself. Truth is the
        substrate’s operating condition, not a negotiable concept.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I say “x = true,” I mean the system has no alternative. Truth is the only
        state in which SECS Sovereign can exist without collapsing.
    </p>
</section>


<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Truth‑Condition Inputs</h2>
    <p>
        Every input is evaluated against doctrine before it is allowed to touch execution.
        This is not validation — it is filtration. Inputs that violate invariants never
        enter the substrate; they are rejected or collapsed at the boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ensures that governed execution begins from a clean state. No impurity,
        nondeterminism, or malformed behaviour is permitted to seed drift.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an input cannot satisfy truth‑conditions, it has no place inside SECS Sovereign.

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Truth‑Condition Outputs</h2>
    <p>
        Outputs are considered true only when they are the deterministic result of
        invariant‑safe inputs processed through governed execution. Nothing else qualifies.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no randomness, no probabilistic behaviour, and no hidden heuristics.
        The substrate produces the same output for the same input, every time, under
        every topology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Truth is not inferred — it is produced through deterministic physics.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Continuity as Truth</h2>
    <p>
        Continuity is the substrate’s memory of itself — the unbroken chain of valid
        state transitions. A transition is true only when it extends that chain without
        contradiction or ambiguity.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is how the system maintains narrative closure. Every state must make sense
        in the context of the last, and every transition must preserve the story the
        substrate is telling about itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Break continuity, and you break truth. The substrate will collapse before it
        allows that to happen.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Purity as Truth</h2>
    <p>
        Purity is the absence of impurity — nondeterminism, drift, fairness bleed,
        topology dependence, or any behaviour that introduces uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
        A behaviour is true only when it preserves purity across execution windows.
        If purity is lost, truth is lost with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Purity is not a goal; it is a requirement for the substrate to remain itself.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Collapse as Truth Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
        Collapse is not failure — it is enforcement. When behaviour diverges from truth,
        the substrate collapses it to prevent impurity from propagating.
    </p>
    <p>
        This mechanism ensures that drift never accumulates and that the system cannot
        be coerced into false states.
    </p>
    <p>
        Collapse is the substrate’s way of saying: “Truth is non‑optional.”
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Truth‑State Integrity</h2>
    <p>
        SECS Sovereign maintains a single global truth‑state. All workers, modes, and
        execution paths must converge on this state or collapse is triggered.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is how the substrate avoids forks, contradictions, and parallel realities.
        There is only one truth, and everything must align with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Integrity is not maintained by consensus — it is enforced by invariants.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Truth and Non‑Forkability</h2>
    <p>
        Truth cannot be forked. The substrate’s truth‑state is singular, canonical,
        and non‑replicable. Any attempt to fork truth results in collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not a licensing constraint — it is a physical one. The guarantees of
        SECS Sovereign cannot be reproduced outside the governed substrate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Truth is a property of the system, not an artifact that can be copied.
