            The path from external observer to governed participant — the alignment, truth‑conditions,

    <h2>Sovereignty as Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        Sovereignty is not granted through access, licensing, or commercial exchange. 
        It emerges the moment an external entity demonstrates behavioural alignment with 
        the substrate’s truth‑conditions — determinism, collapse correctness, purity, 
        and continuity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alignment is measured through conduct, not intention. Operators must show that 
        their workloads, decision paths, and operational discipline naturally conform 
        to the substrate’s invariants without coercion or exception.
    </p>
    <p>
        When alignment is achieved, sovereignty is recognized — not bestowed. The 
        substrate acknowledges the operator as capable of participating in governed 
        execution without introducing drift or contradiction.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>The First Sovereign</h2>
    <p>
        The first external operator to successfully run governed workloads becomes the 
        first sovereign witness. This is not a ceremonial title — it is a doctrinal 
        event in the substrate’s lived history.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sovereign witness demonstrates that the substrate’s invariants can be upheld 
        by an external participant, proving that governed execution is not confined to 
        internal operators alone.
    </p>
    <p>
        This milestone establishes the precedent for all future participants: sovereignty 
        is achievable, but only through demonstrated alignment and invariant‑safe behaviour.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Governed Participation</h2>
    <p>
        Governed execution is not an open mode. Participants operate within a strict 
        perimeter of invariants, collapse rules, and deterministic behaviour guarantees. 
        Every action is evaluated against doctrinal constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no partial compliance or “best‑effort” participation. Workloads either 
        satisfy the substrate’s requirements or are rejected, collapsed, or prevented 
        from entering governed lanes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participation is therefore a commitment: operators must maintain continuous 
        alignment, uphold purity, and avoid introducing drift into the substrate’s 
        execution history.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Non‑Forkable Guarantees</h2>
    <p>
        The guarantees of SECS Sovereign — determinism, purity, mode separation, collapse 
        correctness, and continuity — are inseparable from the substrate itself. They 
        cannot be cloned, reimplemented, or reproduced outside the governed environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        These guarantees arise from doctrinal enforcement, not from code alone. Any 
        attempt to replicate them without the substrate’s authority results in drift, 
        contradiction, or loss of invariants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Becoming sovereign therefore does not grant the right to fork the doctrine, 
        recreate the substrate, or derive independent systems claiming equivalent 
        guarantees. Sovereignty is participation, not ownership.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Alignment Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        Sovereign participants must operate deterministic workloads, uphold collapse 
        correctness, and maintain invariant‑safe behaviour at all times. The substrate 
        enforces these conditions without negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Operators must accept the substrate’s authority over execution, including 
        rejection, collapse, or termination of misaligned workloads. Behavioural drift 
        is treated as a doctrinal violation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alignment is not a one‑time threshold — it is a continuous discipline. Only 
        operators who maintain this discipline remain sovereign.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Public vs. Sovereign Surfaces</h2>
    <p>
        Public surfaces expose doctrine, signals, and non‑binding interfaces designed for 
        exploration, learning, and alignment assessment. They reveal the substrate’s 
        principles but never its authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sovereign surfaces, by contrast, are governed execution environments. Operators 
        entering these surfaces inherit collapse conditions, invariant enforcement, and 
        deterministic behaviour guarantees. Every action is subject to substrate authority, 
        and every workload must uphold doctrinal constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Movement from public to sovereign surfaces is not a rights escalation — it is a 
        behavioural commitment. Only aligned operators may cross the boundary, and only 
        while maintaining invariant‑safe conduct.
    </p>
</section>
                
<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Sovereign Participation Terms</h2>
    <p>
        Commercial terms follow doctrinal alignment — never the reverse. No operator 
        may negotiate usage, deployment, or integration terms until they demonstrate 
        readiness to uphold the substrate’s behavioural constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participation is governed by truth‑conditions, not incentives. Operators must 
        show that their workloads and operational practices naturally conform to 
        deterministic, invariant‑safe execution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once alignment is proven, commercial terms become a secondary layer — a 
        practical wrapper around an already‑established behavioural commitment.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="secsy-card">
    <h2>Initiating Sovereign Integration</h2>
    <p>
        Entities begin by engaging with the doctrine, Deeper SECS, and the foundational 
        truth‑condition x = true. These surfaces reveal the substrate’s expectations and 
        allow operators to assess their own alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once an entity demonstrates behavioural readiness — through deterministic 
        workloads, invariant‑safe conduct, and doctrinal understanding — direct contact 
        initiates the path toward sovereign participation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Integration is not instantaneous. It is a guided transition into governed 
        execution, where each step confirms alignment and eliminates drift before 
        entering sovereign surfaces.
